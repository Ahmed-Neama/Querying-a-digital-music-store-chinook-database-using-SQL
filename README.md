# Querying-a-digital-music-store-chinook-database-using-SQL
Using SQL to query and get insight from chinook database of a digital music store 
This project is related to the advanced data analysis track by Udacity and EGFWD.
I used SQL to query the portions of data that will answer my questions of analysis and Excel to visualize the data as it is.
The database, the queries performed on it and the report are attached.
I am open to any reviews and recommendations!
